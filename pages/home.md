### Welcome!

Hello! My name is **Fankun Zeng**. I earned my Master of Computer Science degree from Washington University in St. Louis in May 2023.

I am currently a Bioinformatics Research Analyst at [Ding Lab](https://dinglab.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis. I am actively seeking exciting job opportunities and exploring potential avenues for pursuing a Ph.D.
