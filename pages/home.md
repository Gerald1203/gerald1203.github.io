### Welcome!

Hello! My name is **Fankun Zeng**. I earned my Master of Computer Science degree from Washington University in St. Louis in May 2023. During my academic journey, I completed my masterâ€™s thesis titled "[Evaluating the Problem Solving Abilities of ChatGPT](https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/eng_etds/849/)", advised by [Prof. Chenguang Wang](https://cgraywang.github.io/). Now, I am a research assistant at [The WashU NLP Group](https://nlp.wustl.edu). And I am actively seeking exciting job opportunities and exploring potential avenues for pursuing a Ph.D.
